                              <h3>History</h3>
                              <p>Cape Town is one of South Africa’s most historically important cities. It was here, in the Mother City. This is where the first European colonists set foot in South Africa—which also marked the beginning of the South African slave trade. It was home to perhaps the world’s most famous political prisoner—Nelson Mandela—who was held on the tiny Robben Island in Table Bay.Province is Western Cape & Municipalicity is the City of Cape Town.</p>

                                TABLE MOUNTAIN ROSE FROM THE SEA
                                
                                Roughly 300 million years ago, during the Karoo Ice Age, Table Mountain wasn’t a mountain at all. It was at sea level—but what lay beneath was layers of sandstone set atop a granite base. Pressure from the underlying magma worked with the ice to harden the top layer,  leaving the iconic flat slab we see today. As the continents tore apart and collided, the city’s famous landmark was gradually forced to rise and it now stands a kilometre tall overlooking the bay.

                              <p>BOULDERS BEACH PENGUINS- HAPPY FEET IN CAPE TOWN

                                Not only does Cape Town have many geological attractions, it also has a lot of wildlife attractions, and in their own natural habitats. In the early 1980’s at Boulders Beach in Simon’s Town along the Cape Town peninsula, just 2 breeding pairs of African penguins showed up, and never left. Today, there are now thousands of penguins in Cape Town calling Boulders beach their home. What makes this even more interesting is Boulders beach is right in the middle of a residential area which allows the little birds to be observed at very close range.

                                <P>SIGNAL HILLS & THE NOON GUN

                                    Five minutes drive west of the city center, Signal Hill offers stunning views over Cape Town, Table Bay, and the glittering Atlantic Ocean from its 350-meter summit. The hill forms the body of the adjacent Lion's Head peak and was named for its historical use when signal flags were flown from here to send messages to approaching ships.
                                    
                                    Many locals and visitors drive up to watch the sunset and stay to see the shimmering lights of Cape Town ignite after dark. At noon every day (except Sundays and public holidays), a cannon activated by an electronic impulse from the Observatory fires a single shot. In earlier days this "noon gun" served to give the exact time to ships anchored in the bay. Tourists are welcome to attend a free presentation on the history of the Noon Gun at the Lion Battery and then stay to watch the firing.

                                <P>THE VICTORIA & ALFRED WATERFONT 

                                    Stretching around two harbor basins, the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront is a buzzing entertainment quarter reminiscent of Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. Once a scruffy fishing harbor, this reimagined waterfront district is now one of the city's top tourist attractions, and many of the old buildings have been preserved and restored. Millions of visitors a year flock here to the shops, jazz venues, restaurants, hotels, theaters, drama school, cinemas, and museums.
                                    
                                    Sports fans will love the Springbok Experience Rugby Museum, which traces the story of South African Rugby through interactive exhibits. Two Oceans Aquarium features more than 300 species of fish from the Atlantic and Indian oceans, in particular from the area around the Cape of Good Hope.

                                    ROBBEN ISLAND 
                                    
                                    For nearly 400 years, Robben Island in Table Bay, was a brutal prison where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years in a tiny cell during the apartheid era. Today, the island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a must-see attraction for anyone interested in South African history. Tours to the island begin with multimedia exhibits in the museum at the Nelson Mandela Gateway on the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront before travelers board vessels to the island. The boat trip takes about 30 minutes to an hour depending on weather conditions and can be rough during big swells.
                                    
                                    While on the island, visitors tour the maximum security prison, Mandela's former cell, and the lime quarry where prisoners were forced to endure back-breaking labor. The interesting part about the tour is that the guides are former prisoners of Robben Island who share their experiences and offer insight into the atrocities of apartheid and the power of forgiveness.

                                   IZIKO MUSEUMS OF SOUTH AFRICA
                                    
                                    Iziko Museums of South Africa comprises 11 museums governed by a council appointed by the Minister of Arts and Culture. A top museum in this group is the Bo-Kaap Museum in the Bo-Kaap District, an old Malay quarter with brightly-painted two-story houses that are still occupied by the descendants of slaves who were brought to the Cape from the East Indies in the second half of the 17th century. This excellent museum illustrates aspects of 19th-century Muslim life in a rare early Cape-Dutch house circa 1763. A room on the premises houses a collection of carts and carriages.
                                    
                                    The Old Town House is another popular attraction in the museum group. It was originally built in 1755 in a Dutch-Rococo style and lies in Cape Town's hub on the west side of Green Market Square. Formerly Cape Town's City Hall, the Old Town House now displays a collection of pictures presented to the country by Sir Max
                                    Michaelis in 1914, consisting mainly of works by 17th-century Dutch and Flemish masters, including Frans Hals, Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruysdael, and Jan van Goyen.
